# NOTES:
    #DEFINITION:
        Protected endpoint is an endpoint which can only be used by authenticated req
    #ENCODED VALUES: 
        values that human wouldn't be able to read and understand w/o using a machine (!= decode)
    #BASIC AUTH:
        involves Base64 endcoding 
        window.btoa() === ``
        window.localStorage.setItem('name', 'value') -> Check at application/storage/localStorage
        TokenService.saveAuthToken(
            TokenService.makeBasicAuthToken(value1,value2)
        )
    # BASIC TOKENS:
    # CREDENTIALS:
    # SENDING CREDENTIALS IN REQ:
# ASSIGNMENT:
    Public:
        The GET /api/things 
    Basic auth:
        The GET /api/things/:thing_id 
        The GET /api/things/:thing_id/reviews 
        The POST /api/reviews endpoint (automatically assign a user_id)
    PrivateRoute:
        If a user tries to view reviews for a thing, they should be redirected to the login form page.
    PublicOnlyRoute:
        If a user attempts to view the login form when they're already logged in, they should be redirected to the thing list page.

    The thingful-client should store the base64 encoded credentials when the login form is submitted.
    The base64 encoded credentials should be sent in requests to protected endpoints.
